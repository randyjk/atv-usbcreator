OSX
 Functional

Linux
 Not functional yet.

Windows
 Not functional yet.



TODO:
 1) Disk handling need improvement, if the usb drive is already mounted, it's going to get yanked out from under OSX.

 2) Need slight re-org to handle multiple distro installs.

 3) Another re-org once Linux and Windows are functional, separate python objects are ok but there's lots of identical code that could be combined in the base class.
