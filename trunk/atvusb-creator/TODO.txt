OSX

 py2app not tested

Linux
 Not functional yet.

Windows
 Not functional yet.



TODO:
 1) Disk handling need improvement, if the usb drive is already mounted, it's going to get yanked out from under OSX.

 2) Need slight re-org to handle multiple distro installs.

 3) Another re-org once Linux and Windows are functional, separate python objects are ok but there's lots of identical code that could be combined in the base class.

 4) re-org the usb disk image and hfs partition image. Instead of doing the dd twice, copy the usb disk image, then dd hfs partition into the copy using and offset and count. The dd that onto the disk. This eliminated the double dd onto the physical flash device.
